# [Premium Prep Docs](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/dsi-premium-prep)
* Our Schedule and Slides are kept in Markdown
* This is the source of truth
* Class recordings (hosted on YouTube) are posted here
* We host these in GitHub in part to get you familiar with GitHub, which you'll be using extensively in your career

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Lecture Etiquette
* Having your camera on is preferred
    * Please be appropriately dressed if your camera is on
* Please set yourself to mute by default, and be conscious of your microphone generally
* Please limit questions to the lecture thread and/or to the specified time allocated by the instructor



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Lecture Recordings
**We will be hosting recordings of these lectures on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC65Th93eDb2iuD-9fZVnjFg)**
* We will update this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/dsi-premium-prep) with links to the recordings
* To maintain privacy and anonymity, please do not say your name or the names of other students. 
    * We will edit those moments out if this occurs, which will delay making the vids available
* We will not say your names. If you notice that we do or if we share any other student info, please inform us by direct message.



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Prep Goals

__Get diverse students to a baseline skill level to pass the Technical Interview__
* Prepping for the DSI can take 3 weeks to 9 months, depending on current skills
* Premium Prep materials parallel Basic Prep
    * **Please Complete Work in our specific Learn cohort**
* We monitor you closely to best advise you toward the Technical Interview
* You should interview as soon as you’re ready!
* If you are an advanced student, we encourage you to let us know so that we can give you other work to do. Premium Prep may not be the best track for you and we want to support you where you are at.

# Supplemental Materials
* If you find yourself ahead or finished with the pre-TI materials, **take the TI**, then do the [Further Studies](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/content_link/github/gSchool/ds-precourse/units/00_pair_programming/00_overview.md) materials on Learn
    * These include most of the required PreCourse materials
* Reach out for more work if you complete the challenges on Learn
* Reach out after you pass the TI, for subject-specific resources or for materials geared toward your weaknesses
* Do reps using [CodeWars.com](http://www.codewars.com/r/xCbgXQ)



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Applying for the DSI
* Get the admissions process started ASAP
    * [https://admissions.galvanize.com/](https://admissions.galvanize.com/)

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Technical Interview

* 45 minutes
* Uses Jupyter Notebooks
* To schedule, you’ll need to pass a coding challenge within the [admissions portal](https://admissions.galvanize.com/)
* Once your python and stats skills are proficient, the [Technical Interview YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5T50pwCrPUofHFV-PuAD6av4uEteuara), is a great resource for gauging readiness for the TI



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

# Facilitators not Gatekeepers
* Technical Interview:
    * Probability and Statistics Fundamentals
    * Python Exercises focusing on implementing mathematical concepts and using the built-in functions and data types
        * Requires fluency with Dictionaries
    * Problem Solving Skills - ability to adapt, and pick up new information quickly

# Growth vs. Fixed Mindset
* You will struggle, and that's a good thing
    * "Even if you can't now, you will soon."

# Thinking Critically
* Early in their education, many aspiring data scientists focus on learning all of the programming tools/languages, mathematics, technologies, etc . . . these are necessary tools, but what makes a great data scientist is more complex:
    * The ability to think critically about a problem, and approach a solution with a scientific/evidence based approach
    * The ability to ask the right question. Asking the question that will lead to an answer which will provide insight to the business, science, or research project they’re working on. 
    * A great data scientist is obsessed with solving complex problems, and will use any tool necessary to come up with an acceptable solution; even when that means they need to make a new tool themselves.
* Develop consciousness of your biases
    * [Wikipedia List of Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Let’s look at Learn, Repl.it, and Google Colabs
* [Learn](http://learn-2.galvanize.com/) houses all your lessons and coding challenges
* [Repl.it](http://repl.it) is a coding environment you can use until you become comfortable with coding in your local environment
* [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com) is a cloud-based environment that runs Jupyter notebooks.  You can use Colabs until you set up your local environment to run Jupyter notebooks



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# BREAKOUT (5 minutes)

1. Set up a repl.it account
2. Create a Repl, add this code and run it:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```
3. Paste the link to your repl in the Slack thread



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# BREAKOUT Solution
If you are having trouble with any of these steps, reach out directly and we'll help get you sorted


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Slack Etiquette
* If you are asking a question on Slack about a specific challenge on Learn, please paste in a link to that challenge, along with a well-formed question
    * Reply to your peers questions within threads in order to keep Slack clean
* During lecture, please keep your questions within the Questions thread on Slack
* Don’t give people the answers
